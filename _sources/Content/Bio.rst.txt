Short Bio
#########

Mr. Lehmann studied computer science at Technische Universit√§t Dresden, Germany.
He started to teach computer engineering and architecture as a tutor. Later on,
he specialized in digital design, FPGA technology, and high speed communications.
He shared his gained knowledge in labs, research articles, and on social
platforms. His research focused on digital designs with VHDL as well as the
integration of EDA design steps into a Git and web services based development
flow. Since 2017, Patrick Lehman is working for PLC2 GmbH as a trainer for VHDL,
OSVVM and PCI Express.

He is one of the developers and maintainers of The PoC-Library, a platform and
vendor independent open source IP core library. He is also a contributor to the
free VHDL simulator GHDL. In 2016, he started an initiative called "Open Source
VHDL Group".

Mr. Lehmann is active in the IEEE P1076 "VHDL Analysis and Standardization
Group" since 2014. He detailed and wrote major parts of the language changes
for the upcoming VHDL revision. In 2017, he became an IEEE Standards
Association member and was announced vice-chair of the P1076 working group.
In this current work, he is working together with IEEE to release all VHDL
language packages as open source, as well as creating a new collaborative,
open source publishing flow in IEEE.
